            My name is <strong>Samin</strong>, I am a 9th grader studying at
            <strong>Banasree National Ideal High School</strong>. <br /><br />
            Back in 2020, I started making games in
            <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox">Roblox</a>. I learned UI
            and UX design from there, and also mastered the programming language
            <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)"
              >Lua</a
            >
            from there. My studies became much more difficult, so I quit game
            development. I also made bots in the platform
            <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord">Discord</a> with
            <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>. Now I am
            preparing to be a Full Stack Web Developer.

        <div class="container"><p class="text-white">I was interested in computers ever since I got to know about them, I thought they were <strong>cool</strong> and turns out, they were! <br><br> Now-a-days, everything special about computers has something to do with the <strong>internet</strong>. And that's where websites come in, they're basically like a <strong>shipping port of information</strong>.
        <br>Now, I just made that up in 2 minutes. There's clearly a better explanation. <br><br>Besides that, website development creates a ton of <strong>job opportunities</strong> and I was interested in it so I've decided to learn about it so I can <strong>contribute to the industry.</strong></p></div>
